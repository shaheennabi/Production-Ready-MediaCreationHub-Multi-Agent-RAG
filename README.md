### Discussions box is open, you can ask anything & i will accept any pull request feel free to contribute (you can later use this project in your resume etc..)

## **Problem Statement**  
---  
*Note: This project simulates an industry-standard scenario where I am assuming the role of a developer at XYZ Company. The client required a system to provide users with accurate, detailed, and instant information about travel destinations. This system was to be embedded into their platform for seamless user experience, ensuring that users could fetch trip details in one go with pinpoint accuracy.*  

*High-Level Note: Some related topics, such as **AI agents**, their pipelines, different types of agents, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems** in general, have already been discussed. You can find these details in the **`docs` folder** for further exploration.*

## **My Approach** ‚ú®üíö  

The project followed a structured approach to ensure efficient execution and high-quality results.  

### **Steps in My Approach**  

1. **Framework Selection**  
    - Chose **Taskflow AI** for its multi-AI agent support and capabilities in modular design.  

2. **Model Selection**  
  - Tested multiple models, including:  
    - **OpenAI Models**:  
      - The **GPT-3.5 Turbo model** was ultimately chosen due to its:  
        - **Tool-Calling Excellence**: It demonstrated the best ability to call tools and manage multi-agent tasks seamlessly, ensuring outstanding integration with the system.  
        - **Token Management**: The model's reasoning capabilities enabled it to self-understand context and optimize token usage, producing exceptional results.  
        - **Report Generation**: Its power to combine, process, and generate final reports effectively, as showcased in this project.  
    - **LLaMA Models**: Failed to handle larger token inputs effectively and lacked robust reasoning capabilities, resulting in subpar outcomes.  
    - **Google Models**: While capable of handling large contexts, they failed in reasoning and memory performance, making them unsuitable for this use case.  
    - **OpenAI's o1 Series Models**: Offered great performance but were prohibitively expensive for this project.  
  - Additionally, tested with **Groq inference engine**, which also failed to meet the project's performance indicators.  

3. **System Design and Development**  
    - Built a **modular architecture** using Taskflow AI, ensuring the system could adapt to future needs and upgrades.  

4. **Cost Optimization**  
    - Prioritized minimizing API costs by choosing the **GPT-3.5 Turbo model** and optimizing system performance.  

5. **Testing and Delivery**  
    - Conducted rigorous testing to validate accuracy and reliability.  
    - Delivered the project on time, exceeding quality expectations.

## **Challenges Encountered** üéã  

The project faced several challenges, including:  
1. **Model API Costs**: Managing the high costs of API calls while ensuring performance.  
2. **Token Limitations**: Handling large queries within the token limits of various models.  
3. **Memory Issues**: Ensuring memory efficiency for better performance.  

---

## **How I Fixed Challenges** üåü  

- **Model API Costs**:  
   - Evaluated multiple models and frameworks, but **GPT-3.5 Turbo** was chosen for its cost-effectiveness and outstanding performance.  

- **Token Limitations**:  
   - OpenAI's **GPT-3.5 Turbo** effectively managed token constraints by leveraging its powerful reasoning capabilities, optimizing token usage, and maintaining context to generate accurate results.  

- **Memory Challenges**:  
  - Compared with other models like LLaMA and Google's offerings, **GPT-3.5 Turbo** proved superior in handling memory-intensive tasks and maintaining consistent performance.

### Deployment Pipeline

![Deployment Pipeline TripPlanner ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aa5d232-3766-4ac1-b48a-eb055ac1f7e7)

See the **deployment diagram** to gain a better understanding of the infrastructure and components involved in the deployment process.

After completing the **main pipeline**, it's now time to deploy it on the cloud. The steps below outline the process for deploying the Dockerized application to AWS using GitHub Actions **Self Hosted Runner**.

Prerequisites:  

- Access to AWS.  
- Necessary API keys and secrets stored securely as GitHub secrets.  
- SSH access to the EC2 instance with an EC2 key pair's PGP key added to GitHub secrets.

Steps to Deploy:

1. **Checkout the Code**  
   Pull the latest code from the `main` branch to ensure the most up-to-date version of the application is deployed.

2. **Verify Docker Setup**  
   Confirm that Docker is installed and properly configured on the self-hosted runner by checking permissions and verifying the Docker daemon.

3. **Build the Docker Image**  
   Create a Docker image for the Streamlit application using the necessary build arguments like API keys.

4. **Authenticate to AWS**  
   Log in to AWS using the provided credentials to access the Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

5. **Push Docker Image to AWS ECR**  
   Tag the Docker image and push it to AWS Elastic Container Registry for deployment.

6. **Deploy to EC2 Instance**  
   - Pull the latest Docker image from AWS ECR onto the EC2 instance.  
   - Stop and remove any running instance of the application.  
   - Run the updated Docker container with the necessary environment variables and expose it on the desired port.


Ensure you store all the API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `WEATHER_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY`, `AMADEUS_API_KEY`, `AMADEUS_API_SECRET`) securely in GitHub secrets.

Ensure you add your EC2 key pair's PGP key to GitHub secrets to allow SSH access to the EC2 instance.

If you want to see the detailed YAML configuration file for this workflow, navigate to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

If you need **Docker** and **GitHub Self-Hosted Runner** commands, I have provided them in the `scripts.sh` file. However, note that GitHub **Self-Hosted Runner** commands are different for every account. Go to -> **Repo Settings** -> **Actions** -> **Runners** -> New Self-Hosted Runner.

## Guide for Developers üåøüéá‚ú®üíöüéÜüå±üéá‚ú®üíöüéÜ 

Dear Developers,  

To create a similar project, set up your environment using Python 3.10 or above with Conda:  
```bash  
conda create -p your_env_name python=3.10
```
Activate the env:
```bash
conda activate your_env_path  
```
Then, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
I recommend using TaskflowAI here because of its modularity design, which is crucial for building scalable AI/ML applications. When productionizing AI or ML apps, having a modular design from the beginning is essential. So, I recommend following the main pipeline and deployment steps as outlined.

You can fork this repo as TaskflowAI is simple and easy to understand. Here is the documentation link: [TaskflowAI Documentation](https://www.taskflowai.org/). Feel free to explore more or contribute. It provides tools to work with multi-AI agents and multi-agent system design easily, and there are also other frameworks such as Langchain's **langgraph**, **crewai** etc, you can use those too.

Happy coding and building multi-ai-agent-system! üéâüíö
