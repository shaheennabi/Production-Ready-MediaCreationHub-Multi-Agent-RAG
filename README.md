## System Design or Project Pipeline
### Main Pipeline

![TripPlanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f1226e-2e3c-4ae7-999f-9ff0db143bc7)

### Let's Start with LLM OpenAI: (GPT-3.5 Turbo):

![Screenshot 2024-12-22 014852](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c33b9de0-e125-4ee7-8fff-67dc952dfe0f)

- In this example, I am loading the **GPT-3.5 Turbo** model from **taskflowai.OpenaiModels**.  
- This model is efficient, cost-effective, and performs exceptionally well for most tasks.  
- Make sure to load the OpenAI API key properly.  
- It is recommended to store the API key securely using a `.env` file or a similar approach.  

### Now let's task about the Agents:
Web Research Agent: 

  ![Screenshot 2024-12-22 014625](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83e0f923-6e4e-4763-b11d-09980ea09458)

- Here, I define the **Web Research Agent**, which is responsible for conducting web-based research and retrieving relevant information.  
- I assign the role of "Web Research Agent" to the agent, ensuring it focuses on researching destinations and finding related images.  
- The **goal** is set to perform thorough and comprehensive research with a visual focus.  
- I specify **attributes** like diligence, thoroughness, and visual-focus to guide the agent's behavior during tasks.  
- I load the OpenAI model using `LoadModel.load_openai_model()` to empower the agent with natural language processing capabilities.  
- I include tools like:
  - **SerperSearch**: For detailed web searches.  
  - **WikiArticles**: To fetch related articles for context.  
  - **WikiImages**: To search and retrieve relevant images.
 
Travel Agent:

- Here, I define the **Travel Agent**, which is designed to assist travelers with their queries, focusing on searching for flights and retrieving weather data.  
- The **role** assigned to the agent is "Travel Agent," ensuring its primary function is to help travelers.  
- The **goal** is set to assist travelers by providing relevant information such as flight details and weather conditions.  
- I specify **attributes** like friendliness, hard work, and attention to detail to ensure the agent delivers thorough and useful responses.  
- I load the OpenAI model using `LoadModel.load_openai_model()` to provide natural language processing capabilities.  
- I include tools like:
  - **SearchFlights**: A tool for searching and retrieving flight information using the Amadeus API.  
  - **GetWeatherData**: A tool for fetching real-time weather data from weather.com API.  

Reporter Agent:  

![Screenshot 2024-12-22 014515](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6928996a-69c2-49f2-af66-911be403e60f)

- Here, I define the **Travel Report Agent**, which aggregates data from various agents like the Web Search Agent and Travel Agent to generate comprehensive and summarized travel reports.  
- The **role** assigned to the agent is "Travel Report Agent," ensuring its focus on collecting and synthesizing travel-related information.  
- The **goal** is to write detailed, visual-oriented, and comprehensive travel reports based on inputs from other agents, covering destination details, dates, weather reports, flight information, and events at the location.  
- I specify **attributes** like friendliness, hard work, visual focus, and attention to detail to ensure the agent delivers well-structured, insightful, and informative reports.  
- I load the OpenAI model using `LoadModel.load_openai_model()` to provide natural language processing and text generation capabilities.  
- The agent relies on tools and data from other agents, such as:
  - **Web Search Agent**: Provides destination details and event-related information.  
  - **Travel Agent**: Supplies weather reports and flight information.  

### Now let's talk about Tools

Wiki Image Search Tool:

Serper Search Tool:

![Screenshot 2024-12-22 021920](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2152df64-700d-428f-a86e-597091f7af79)

- Here, I define the **SerperSearch tool**, which is responsible for performing web searches using **TaskflowAI's WebTools**.  
- The **goal** of the tool is to retrieve search results from the web based on specific queries or topics.  
- It leverages **WebTools** from TaskflowAI to perform search operations using the SerperSearch API.  

Weather Fetching Tool:

![Screenshot 2024-12-22 022133](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f573e7f3-abf5-4ace-9c81-c0d0abb28be4)
